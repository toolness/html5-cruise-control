This is a prototype of a simple two-paned editor that adds
affordances to learn HTML in a way that's slightly reminiscent
of [Let Me Google That For You](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=condescend), albeit
with much less condescension.

The prototype is all static HTML, though because it uses
ajax requests to retrieve some of its files, you'll likely need to
host it on a `http:` URL (not a `file:` URL) to make it work. One
easy way to do this is with [python][].
